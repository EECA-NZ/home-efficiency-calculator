# Test Data Directory

This folder contains **mocked** or **synthetic** data files used by our test suite. They are **not** real production data and should **not** be used for any actual modeling or calculations beyond testing.

## Purpose

1. **Testing**: Provide consistent, non-sensitive sample data so that automated tests can run without requiring private datasets.
2. **Isolation**: Ensure real, private data can remain safely out of the public repository.
3. **Reproducibility**: Allow developers and CI services to reproduce the same test results locally or remotely.
